This is a post like application designed to practice crud operations with a mongoDB with a full-stack project. The back-end was designed using express that interacts with the mongoDB and the front-end using React to interact with the express server. 

First register at least one user to be put in the database, registering more profiles allows you to add and remove friends.

After you are registered you will be prompted to login where you will obtain a Bearer token that you will use to do the rest of the crud operations on the database. 

Once you are logged into the database you can access all the posts created. You can create, update, and delete the posts. You can also see other users that you can add and remove as well.
